WHAT
~~~~

This is a quick implementation of the minimal interface to Readline
libraries. The implementation is made in Perl (mostly) by Jeffrey
Friedl. The only thing this library does is to make it conformant (and
add some minimal changes, like using Term::ReadKey if present, and
correct work under xterm). 

Due to some bug in debugger support, it works in debugger on a verge
of breakup (under the version that supports readline). By default,
ReadLine is enabled under debugger, to disable it set the environment
variable PERLDB_RL to 'no' (without quotes).

INSTALL
~~~~~~~

To install this module type

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
		or (with newer makemaker)
	make test_dynamic
		(Check whether you are satisfied with the results. Try
		to redirect stdin and/or stdout.)
	make install

You may need to install Term::ReadKey first if your system is new (Solaris
is ;-(). (Available in standard places, checked with 1.98.)

If you see something like

Can't ioctl TIOCGETP: Invalid argument at ...

this means you need ReadKey.

While the following remark may be still true, the bug in perl that
caused all the grieve is localized now and a patch is issued. Anyway,
the workaround is in the ReadLine code for a long time.

Code is very fragile so far. It works, but very small changes can kill
it. In particular, to have it work under debugger I needed to remove
the subroutine &preinit and substitute the call to the actual text of
the subroutine (in Term/ReadLine/ReadLine/readline.pl).
	Another bug is that you cannot uncomment the line 434 (this
one can be related to ReadKey package, but the previous one manifests
itself even when NO dynamically loaded code is present).

CHANGES
~~~~~~~
0.2: Test added.
0.3: Filehandles changed to \* from *, MinLine works, works with
debugger.
0.4: Some bugs with $| corrected. Application name is set. Works under
OS/2 without ReadKey. Should work under DOS with minimal changes (see
$inDOS in ReadLine/readline.pl).
0.5: Code to support ReadLine'less debugger moved to debugger. One
user reported that having .inputrc triggers the same bug that buggered
earlier versions of the package. Request for a second readline is
tried to be executed first, dying only if should work on a different terminal.
0.6: The above bug was due to missing vi keymap. Dirty workaround
added.
0.7: We made ReadMode on term_OUT ;-(
     Better workaround for return of globs from a sub.
     Word break chars more suitable for Perl.
0.8: Insert, Operate, HistorySearch added.
     Rudimental support for tk being active during ReadLine.
     Should work better if ReadKey is present, but did not bootstrap.
     SelfLoader (and AutoLoader) supported (uncomment the lines
	with SelfLoader, ISA, and __DATA__).
0.9: tkRunning corrected. New attributes in Features: getHistory,
	setHistory, and new methods: GetHistory and SetHistory.
